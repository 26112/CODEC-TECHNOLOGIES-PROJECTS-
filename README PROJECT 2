# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis & Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and building a **Machine Learning model** to predict weather parameters (like temperature) based on historical weather data.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Analyze historical weather data to identify trends and patterns.
- Clean and preprocess weather-related features.
- Build and evaluate a model to predict weather conditions like temperature, humidity, or rainfall.
- Visualize findings and forecast using regression algorithms.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Historical weather data (Kaggle/CSV format)
- **Columns**: Date, Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Weather Condition, etc.
- **Size**: ~1,000–10,000 records depending on the dataset

---

## 📊 Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Date/time conversion
   - Feature engineering (e.g., extracting month, day from date)
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing temperature and humidity trends
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Seasonality or time-based patterns

3. **Modeling**
   - Train-test split
   - Model selection: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
   - Evaluation metrics: MAE, MSE, R² Score
